# Greetings, I'm Dante Tanjuatco [![](LinkedIn_Icon.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtsd/)
`pwd` ***University of California San Diego*** studying Computer Science.

Ever since my first CS class in 2019, programming has slowly been taking its place in my life. Currently, I'm learning new programming skills *(mostly web dev)* daily and trying to figure out what it is I want to achieve with said skills. Be it in class or through personal projects.

**CURRENTLY LEARNING SKILLS**
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [ ] Javascript

One quote I live by is from Jurassic Park by Dr. Ian Malcom: 
> Yeah, yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.

Jeff Goldblum's voice echoes in my mind whenever I hop right into programming something with no forward planning or thinking.

**CURRENT CLASSES** 
* *Sofware Engineering*
* *Computer Architecture (SW Perspective)*
* *Statistics*


# OUTSIDE OF CLASS 	ðŸŽ®
Probably my biggest hobby is gaming. I play everything from shooters to rythm games. However, my favorite genre would have to be JRPG's. Games like Dragon Quest, Persona, and even Yakuza have got me racking thousands of hours game time. From the grueling grinds to the 30th attempt at a hard boss, I enjoy every aspect of learning and struggling in a game.

**TOP 3 GAMES**
1. Dragon Quest VII
2. Persona 3
3. Yakuza 0
